    ### Display ###

    # Which monitor should the notifications be displayed on.
    # monitor = 0

    # Display notification on focused monitor.  Possible modes are:
    #   mouse: follow mouse pointer
    #   keyboard: follow window with keyboard focus
    #   none: don't follow anything
    #
    # "keyboard" needs a window manager that exports the
    # _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW property.
    # This should be the case for almost all modern window managers.
    #
    # If this option is set to mouse or keyboard, the monitor option
    # will be ignored.
    follow = none

    ### Geometry ###

    # The width of the window, excluding the frame.
    # dynamic width from 0 to 300
    width = (0, 800)
    # constant width of 300
    # width = 300

    # The height of a single notification, excluding the frame.
    # dynamic height from 0 to 300
    height = (0, 300)
    # constant height of 300
    # height = 300
    # NOTE: Dunst from version 1.11 and older don't support dynamic height
    #       and the given value is treated as the maximum height
